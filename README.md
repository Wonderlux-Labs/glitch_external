**[🗺️ VIEW THE LIVE MAP →](https://wonderlux-labs.github.io/glitch_external/)**

Real-time location tracking for the GlitchCube at Burning Man 2025.

## Features

✅ **Always Available** - Works even when the main API is offline  
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Live location data with smart refresh intervals  
✅ **Offline Resilient** - Browser caching and fallback data  
✅ **Mobile Friendly** - Responsive design for all devices  

## Technical Details

This is a static site generated from live API data, with multiple fallback layers for maximum reliability:

1. **Live API Data** - Fetched fresh when available
2. **Browser Cache** - localStorage for offline viewing
3. **Repository Cache** - Last known good location stored in git
4. **Static Fallback** - Demo location when all else fails

Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Leaflet.js maps. No dependencies, maximum compatibility.

## Development

See the `sinatra-app/` directory for the Ruby/Sinatra version that can be self-hosted.

The static version is automatically generated by GitHub Actions and deployed to GitHub Pages.
